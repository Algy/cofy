to do (random order):
  - regular expressions
  - static environment analysis -> syntax macros!
  - a way for iteration (either trampoline or recur syntax)
  - full javascript interop (or reasonably limited for security)
  - running scripts from application/x-cofy script tags
  - language library (in cofy itself)
  - modules (passing external bindings)

  - persistent data structures
  - lazy sequences (maybe just library)
  - compile mode using eval (after having benchmarks)
  - server-side compiler to javascript
