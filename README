The purpose of this project is to allow executing dynamically generated code
inside a web browser without security risks. For that purpose a small dialect of
Lisp is used.

There are three stages of the code:

 1. textual representation of the source in a string
 2. parsed recursive lisp data structures
 3. compiled functions ready for evaluation

A result of the evaluated functions is a Lisp data structure.
A lisp datastucture can be sonverted to a string or compiled as a Lisp program.
This allows for flexible metaprogramming.

Evaluation environment is capability-based. The evaluated code has access only
to features which are passed by the invoking code.
