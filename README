to do (random order):
  - a way for iteration (either trampoline or recur syntax)
  - controlled mutable references
  - full javascript interop (or reasonably limited for security)
  - running scripts from application/x-cofy script tags
  - language library (in cofy itself)

  - lazy sequences (maybe just library)
  - compile mode using eval (after having benchmarks)
