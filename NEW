    Lazy sequences. All list functions now accept/return lazy sequences (lazy-seq).
    pair? - test for cons or lazy cons
    lazy-seq - takes a function and evaluates it only if the content is accessed
    lazy-seq? - test for seq created by lazy-seq
    seq? - test for empty/non-empty, seq/lazy-seq
    empty? - test for empty seq/lazy-seq
    realized? - whether this node of lazy-seq was already accessed and its value cached
    first, rest - work with lazy-seq the same as with cons cells
    apply - realizes the seq and passes values to a function
    = - works for lazy-seqs and compares to cons cells by content
    filter - a seq to a filtered lazy-seq
    map - a seq(s) to a transformed lazy-seq
    reduce - a seq to a value
    zip - seqs to an iterleaved lazy-seq
    repeat - an infinite lazy-seq repeating the given arguments
    iterate - an infinite lazy-seq of X, f(X), f(f(X)), f(f(f(X))), ...
    take - a lazy-seq containing the first N items of the given seq
    skip - a lazy-seq containing all but the first N items of the given seq
